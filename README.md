## Platforms
All **Linux** platforms are supported, just make sure you have a **1920x0180** resolution monitor. Soon i'll work for **Windows** compatibility.
## Installation 
Move the `icon.png` and `tk_calc.py` files in your absolute path, and move the file `calculator.sh` into the Desktop.
## Basic Usage
when you start the app you can see this

**To write with your keyboard click on the box on top where the numbers are displayed**

Hope there's nothing to say about basic operations... :no_mouth:

the **%** must take the number from the box, so type your number and then click on that button, a new window will popup, in the box you will type the percentage you want to use, next hit **submit** and you will see the result in the calculator.
**This function actually takes only a number**

**AC** button deletes everything, the button **C** deletes only the last character.

**√** button must have only a number too as well as the **%** button and it executes the square root of the number inputted.

**Change theme** changes the theme from light to dark and from dark to light.

**DON'T CARE ABOUT IF YOU CLICK AN OPERATOR SIGN AND THE INPUT IS DIFFERENT, BECAUSE I MADE IT ALREADY READABLE FOR THE PYTHON ENGINE**

## Uninstall
To remove all the files go into your main directory and delete `icon.png`,`tk_calc.py` and the sh file in your desktop.
